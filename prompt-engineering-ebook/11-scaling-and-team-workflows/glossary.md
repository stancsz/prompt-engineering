# Glossary of Terms & Acronyms for Chapter 11

*   **Access Control and Permissions**: Defining who has permission to read, create, modify, approve, or retire prompts within the library.
*   **Collaboration**: Adopting established software development practices becomes essential.
*   **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically publish approved prompt templates to production endpoints or shared libraries.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically build and test prompts on each commit.
*   **Experiment Run Tracking**: Recording all relevant information about each "run" or iteration of a prompt experiment.
*   **Experiment Tracking**: Recording all relevant information about each "run" or iteration of a prompt experiment.
*   **LangSmith**: A dedicated platform by LangChain for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring LLM applications built with LangChain.
*   **Metadata**: Additional information stored alongside each prompt that provides context, usage guidelines, and performance insights.
*   **Metadata and Tagging**: Attaching descriptive information to runs and prompts to facilitate search, filtering, and analysis.
*   **MLflow**: An open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, reproducible runs, and model management.
*   **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)**: Connecting prompt experimentation and management into the broader Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lifecycle, which encompasses data management, model development, deployment, and monitoring.
*   **MLOps Integration**: Connecting prompt experimentation and management into the broader Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) lifecycle, which encompasses data management, model development, deployment, and monitoring.
*   **MLOps Platforms**: Tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, or DVC can help track prompt versions alongside model versions and data.
*   **Prompt Linting**: Automated static analysis of prompt text and structure to enforce coding standards, best practices, and identify potential issues early.
*   **Prompt Management Platforms**: Platforms for sharing, discovering, and managing LangChain prompts.
*   **Prompt Quality**: Akin to code quality.
*   **Prompt Registry / Library**: A centralized, versioned collection of all prompts, prompt templates, few-shot examples, and associated metadata used across an organization or project. It serves as the single source of truth for all prompt assets.
*   **Prompt Review Checklist**: A standardized set of criteria that reviewers use to evaluate prompt changes during a pull request.
*   **Pull Requests (or Merge Requests) for Prompts**: Any change to a prompt (new prompt, update, deprecation) is proposed via a pull request.
*   **Repository Management**: Practices is essential for ensuring consistency, discoverability, reusability, and version control of your prompts at scale.
*   **Review Processes**: And a focus on **prompt quality** akin to code quality.
*   **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly defined roles for prompt creation, review, and approval within the team.
*   **Tagging and Categorization**: Organizing prompts using a structured hierarchy and descriptive tags to improve searchability and management.
*   **Testing Suite**: Unit tests for prompt rendering, end-to-end tests against a sandbox LLM.
*   **Treating Prompts as Code (Version Control)**: Manage prompt templates and configurations in a version control system (e.g., Git) alongside your application code.
*   **Versioning**: Tracking changes to prompts over time, allowing for rollbacks to previous versions, A/B testing of new versions, and clear understanding of what prompt is deployed where.
*   **Versioned Releases**: Tag stable prompt sets (e.g., `v1.0`) and maintain changelogs.
*   **Visualization and Dashboards**: Using interactive dashboards to compare experiment runs, visualize performance trends, and identify optimal prompt configurations.
*   **Weights & Biases (W&B)**: A popular MLOps platform for experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration.
*   **ZenML / Kedro (Orchestration Frameworks)**: MLOps frameworks that help build and orchestrate end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
