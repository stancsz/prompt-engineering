# 11.3 Collaboration, Review Processes & Code Quality

Ensuring high quality and shared understanding requires formal review and collaboration workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Pull Requests for Prompts:** Treat prompt changes like code, with diffs and discussions.  
- **Prompt Linting:** Automated checks for style, required sections, forbidden patterns.  
- **Review Checklist:** Verify clarity, correctness, coverage of edge cases, and security.  
- **Roles & Responsibilities:** Define who can propose, review, and approve prompt changes.

## Example Workflow

1. **Authoring:** Contributor submits a new prompt template in `prompts/` with metadata.  
2. **Linting:** CI runs a prompt-linter (e.g., checks placeholders, length limits).  
3. **Review:** Peers comment on format, examples, and wording in a pull request.  
4. **Approval:** Maintainers merge when all checks pass and no blocking comments remain.

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Clone your `prompt-library` repo.  
2. Add a new prompt file under `classification/`.  
3. Create a pull request and assign a teammate to review.  
4. Run a simple linter (script or regex) to enforce naming conventions.  
5. Iterate based on review feedback until merge.

## Reflection

- Which review comments improved prompt clarity the most?  
- How did linting catch errors before human review?  
- What process changes would streamline collaboration?
