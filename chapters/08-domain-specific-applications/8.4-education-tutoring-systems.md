# 8.4 Education & Tutoring Systems

LLM‐powered tutors can provide explanations, quizzes, and personalized feedback.

## Key Concepts

- **Scaffolding:** Gradually reduce support as learner gains mastery.  
- **Adaptive Questioning:** Adjust difficulty based on learner responses.  
- **Feedback & Hints:** Offer targeted guidance without giving away answers.  
- **Assessment & Tracking:** Record performance to tailor future prompts.

## Example Prompt Flow

1. **Explain a Concept**  
   ```
   You are a math tutor. Explain the Pythagorean theorem in simple terms.
   ```
2. **Quiz Question**  
   ```
   Now ask a question: “If a right triangle has legs of length 3 and 4, what is the hypotenuse?”
   ```
3. **Hint & Feedback**  
   ```
   The student answered “6.” Provide a hint guiding them to recalculate without revealing the answer.
   ```
4. **Assessment Summary**  
   ```
   Summarize the student’s performance: which steps were correct, where they struggled, and next practice topics.
   ```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Create a prompt chain: explanation → question → hint → summary.  
2. Test with several student answers (correct and incorrect).  
3. Adjust hint wording to maximize clarity and encouragement.

## Reflection

- How did scaffolding improve comprehension?  
- What patterns in student responses did you observe?  
- How might you track progress across multiple sessions?
