# 8.1 Chatbots & Virtual Assistants

Designing prompts for conversational agents requires context management, user intent detection, and natural dialogue flow.

## Key Concepts

- **Persona & Tone:** Define the assistant’s role (friendly, formal, expert).  
- **Context Tracking:** Preserve conversation history and state.  
- **Slot Filling:** Elicit and fill missing information from the user.  
- **Fallback Handling:** Gracefully manage unrecognized inputs.

## Example Prompt

```
You are a friendly travel assistant. A user says: 
"I need to book a flight to Paris next Tuesday."
Ask for departure city, preferred airline, and seat class.
```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Simulate a booking flow:
   - Prompt to gather origin, destination, dates.  
   - Prompt to confirm details and request payment information.  
2. Test in an LLM playground, varying roles (e.g., “expert concierge”).

## Reflection

- How did persona affect user engagement?  
- Which prompt structure minimized ambiguous replies?  
- How would you handle unexpected user questions?
