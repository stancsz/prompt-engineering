# Glossary of Terms & Acronyms for Chapter 8

*   **Abstractive Summarization:** A summarization technique that generates new sentences and phrases to capture the main ideas of the original text, often paraphrasing or rephrasing content.
*   **Adaptive Questioning:** Adjusting the difficulty, type, or focus of questions and explanations based on the learner's previous responses, identified strengths, and weaknesses.
*   **Classification:** Assigning predefined labels or categories to a piece of text based on its content (e.g., sentiment, topic, intent).
*   **Compression Ratio:** In summarization, the ratio of the output length to the input length, indicating how much the text has been condensed.
*   **Context Tracking:** The ability of a chatbot to remember and refer to previous turns in the conversation, user preferences, or external information.
*   **Data Extraction (Information Extraction):** Identifying and pulling specific pieces of information (entities, facts, relationships) from unstructured text and presenting them in a structured format.
*   **Dialogue Management:** Guiding the LLM to produce responses that facilitate natural conversation flow, including asking follow-up questions, confirming understanding, and transitioning topics smoothly.
*   **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** A data integration process where LLMs can automate the "Extract" (reading data from a source) and "Transform" (converting extracted data into a desired format) stages.
*   **Extractive Summarization:** A summarization technique that identifies and extracts key sentences or phrases directly from the original text without altering them.
*   **Fallback Handling:** Gracefully managing situations where the LLM cannot understand the user's input, cannot fulfill the request, or generates an irrelevant response.
*   **Fidelity to Source:** In summarization, how accurately the summary reflects the original text's meaning and facts.
*   **Free Translation (Idiomatic/Fluent):** A translation style that prioritizes conveying the original meaning and intent in a natural, idiomatic way in the target language, even if it means deviating from the source's exact phrasing or structure.
*   **Intent Classification:** Identifying the user's goal or purpose in a conversational turn (e.g., "book a flight," "check order status").
*   **Intent Detection:** Understanding the user's goal or purpose in a conversational interaction.
*   **Key-Value Pair Extraction:** Pulling specific data points and their associated values from unstructured text.
*   **Literal Translation (Word-for-Word):** A translation style that focuses on translating each word or phrase as directly as possible, often without much regard for idiomatic expressions or natural flow in the target language.
*   **Long-Term Memory (External):** Storing and retrieving relevant information from a vector database (RAG) or other structured memory stores for a chatbot.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and categorizing named entities in text into predefined categories (e.g., person, organization, location, date, product).
*   **Personalized Learning Paths:** Tailoring educational content, examples, and pace to individual learner needs and preferences.
*   **Persona and Tone:** Defining a consistent character, role, and communication style for a virtual assistant or educational tutor.
*   **Relationship Extraction:** Identifying semantic relationships between entities in text (e.g., "CEO of [Company]," "born in [Year]").
*   **Scaffolding:** Providing varying levels of support to a learner in an educational system, gradually reducing assistance as their mastery increases.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
*   **Short-Term Memory (In-Context):** Including recent conversational turns directly in the prompt for a chatbot, limited by the LLM's context window.
*   **Slot Filling:** Identifying and extracting specific pieces of information (slots) required to fulfill a user's intent.
*   **Topic Classification:** Categorizing documents or sentences by subject matter (e.g., "sports," "finance," "technology").
*   **Turn-Taking:** Guiding the LLM to produce responses that facilitate natural conversation flow in a dialogue.
