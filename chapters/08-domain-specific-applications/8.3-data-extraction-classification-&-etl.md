# 8.3 Data Extraction, Classification & ETL

Extracting structured data from unstructured text unlocks analytics and automation.

## Key Concepts

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify and classify entities (people, dates, locations).  
- **Classification:** Assign labels to text (sentiment, topic).  
- **ETL Workflow:** Extract → Transform → Load into a database or file.

## Example Prompts

- **Entity Extraction**  
  ```
  You are a data extractor. From the text below, list all dates and monetary amounts as JSON:
  <input text>
  ```
- **Classification**  
  ```
  Classify each sentence in the following text as positive, negative, or neutral:
  <input text>
  ```
- **Transformation**  
  ```
  You are an ETL assistant. Convert this CSV snippet into JSON array of records:
  <CSV snippet>
  ```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Provide a news paragraph:  
   - Extract entities (dates, organizations) as JSON.  
   - Classify each sentence by topic.  
   - Transform output into a pandas DataFrame and save as CSV.  
2. Compare model output to a rule-based regex extractor.  

## Reflection

- How accurate was entity extraction vs. classification?  
- What prompt patterns improved structured output?  
- How did loading into a database compare to file export?
