# 8.2 Summarization & Translation

Summarization and translation tasks require controlling output length, fidelity to source, and style.

## Key Concepts

- **Extractive vs. Abstractive Summaries**  
  - Extractive: Select key sentences verbatim.  
  - Abstractive: Generate concise paraphrases.
- **Compression Ratio**  
  - Ratio of output length to input length; trade-off between brevity and completeness.
- **Literal vs. Free Translation**  
  - Literal: Word‐for‐word fidelity.  
  - Free: Preserve meaning, adapt phrasing.

## Example Prompts

- **Abstractive Summary**  
  ```
  You are a summarization assistant. Condense the following article into one paragraph preserving key facts:
  <article text>
  ```
- **Bullet Summary**  
  ```
  Summarize the text below into three bullet points:
  <text>
  ```
- **Translation**  
  ```
  Translate this sentence to Spanish, preserving tone and formality:
  “Our quarterly results exceeded expectations.”
  ```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Paste a 500-word news article into your playground:  
   - Generate an extractive summary by instructing “List the three most important sentences.”  
   - Generate an abstractive summary with “In two sentences, summarize…”  
2. Translate the summary into two languages (e.g., French and Japanese).  
3. Compare literal vs. free translations by tweaking prompts.

## Reflection

- How did output change when adjusting compression ratio?  
- Which style preserved nuance best?  
- What prompt modifications improved fluency in translation?
