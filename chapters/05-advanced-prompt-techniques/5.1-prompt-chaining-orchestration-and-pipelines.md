# 5.1 Prompt Chaining, Orchestration & Pipelines

Combining multiple prompts in sequence lets you build complex workflows, decompose tasks, and pass context between steps.

## Concept

- **Prompt Chain:** A series of prompts where each uses the previous output as input.  
- **Orchestration:** Driving logic (conditional branches, loops) around chains.  
- **Pipeline:** Structured flow of prompts with clear inputs/outputs.

## Example Workflow

1. **Extraction Step:**  
   ```
   You are a data extractor. From the text below, list all dates mentioned:
   <input text>
   ```
2. **Transformation Step:**  
   ```
   You are an event planner. Given these dates, create a schedule template with placeholders.
   ```
3. **Output Step:**  
   ```
   You are a document formatter. Fill the template with dates and default times.
   ```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Choose a multi-part task (e.g., “analyze sentiment then summarize negative feedback”).  
2. Write three prompts:  
   - Sentiment classification  
   - Filter negative items  
   - Summarize remaining feedback  
3. Run each in order, passing outputs manually or via a script.

## Reflection

- How did chaining simplify the overall prompt?  
- Where did context need manual cleanup or reformatting?  
- How might you automate chaining with a scripting framework (e.g., LangChain)?
