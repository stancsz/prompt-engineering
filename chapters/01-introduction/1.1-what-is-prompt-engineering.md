# 1.1 What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining the text inputs (“prompts”) given to large language models (LLMs) to elicit useful, accurate, and context-aware responses.

## Why It Matters

- Models can misunderstand vague or ambiguous prompts.  
- A well-crafted prompt guides the model to “think” in the right direction, improving reliability and usefulness.  
- Prompt engineering bridges the gap between human intent and model behavior.

## Example

**Prompt:**  
```
You are an expert teacher. Explain in simple terms: “What is prompt engineering?”  
```

**Model Response (example):**  
> Prompt engineering involves writing clear, specific instructions that guide AI models to produce desired outputs. It’s like asking precise questions to get precise answers.

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Copy the example prompt into your favorite LLM playground (e.g., OpenAI Playground or HuggingFace).  
2. Modify the role from “expert teacher” to “software engineer.” Observe how the tone and depth change.  
3. Try removing context (“You are an expert teacher”). How does the response differ?  

## Reflection

- Which version gave the clearest explanation?  
- How did changing the role affect the answer’s depth and style?
