# 1.3 Scope and Objectives of Prompting

Prompting shapes every interaction with an LLM. Clear goals help you craft effective prompts.

## Scope

- **Instructional Prompts** – Direct commands (“Translate this sentence”).  
- **Exploratory Prompts** – Open questions (“What are potential risks of AI?”).  
- **Completion Prompts** – Fill-in-the-blank or continuation tasks.  
- **Conversational Prompts** – Dialogue-based interactions.  

## Objectives

1. **Clarity** – Remove ambiguity.  
2. **Relevance** – Include only necessary context.  
3. **Control** – Guide output format and length.  
4. **Robustness** – Handle edge cases and errors.  

## Example

**Prompt Template:**  
```
You are a {role}. {instruction}. Output must be {format}.
```  
- role: “data analyst”  
- instruction: “Summarize customer feedback into key themes”  
- format: “a bullet list of three items”

**Filled Prompt:**  
```
You are a data analyst. Summarize customer feedback into key themes. Output must be a bullet list of three items.
```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Identify a task you perform daily (e.g., scheduling, summarizing).  
2. Draft a prompt using the template above.  
3. Test it in an LLM playground with two different roles.  
4. Compare outputs and refine wording for consistency.

## Reflection

- Which template variable had the biggest impact on output?  
- How did format constraints change the model’s response?
