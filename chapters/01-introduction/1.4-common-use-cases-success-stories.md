# 1.4 Common Use Cases & Success Stories

Prompt engineering powers a wide variety of real-world applications. Reviewing examples helps you see patterns and inspires your own prompts.

## Use Case: Customer Support Bot

**Prompt:**  
```
You are a friendly support agent. A user writes:
"I received the wrong size shirt, what do I do?"
Respond with a polite troubleshooting flow and options.
```

**Hands-On Exercise**  
1. Modify the prompt to handle a damaged-item complaint.  
2. Test in an LLM playground. Compare clarity and tone.

## Use Case: Content Summarization

**Prompt Template:**  
```
You are a summarization assistant. Summarize the following article into three bullet points:
<article text>
```

**Hands-On Exercise**  
1. Paste a 200-word news snippet.

## Success Story: AutoGPT Agentic Workflow

A team built an AutoGPT agent that autonomously researched competitors, drafted a report, and emailed stakeholders. Key prompt patterns included:

- **Task Decomposition:** “First, list key competitor names. Next, gather recent news articles. Finally, compile a report.”  
- **Role-Based Prompts:** “You are a market researcher; provide insights with citations.”  
- **Iteration Loop:** “If any section is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.”

**Hands-On Exercise**  
1. Draft your own three-step task decomposition for research.  
2. Simulate the loop in an LLM playground by chaining three prompts in sequence.
