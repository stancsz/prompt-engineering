# Appendix A: Prompt Cookbook â€“ Practical Templates, Snippets & Patterns

This cookbook provides a curated collection of reusable prompt templates, snippets, and design patterns, designed for immediate practical application. Use these as robust starting points for common tasks, adapting them to your specific needs and iterating for optimal performance in real-world scenarios.

## General Principles for Effective Prompt Engineering

-   **Adapt, Don't Just Copy:** These templates are foundational. Always modify them to precisely fit your specific context, desired tone, and output format. Blindly copying may yield suboptimal results.
-   **Iterate Relentlessly:** Prompt engineering is an inherently iterative process. Systematically experiment with variations, rigorously evaluate outputs against your criteria, and refine your prompts based on empirical results.
-   **Context is Paramount:** The quality of your output is directly proportional to the relevance and clarity of the context you provide. More pertinent context consistently leads to superior results.
-   **Clarity and Specificity are Key:** Be unequivocally explicit about your instructions, constraints, and the exact desired output format. Ambiguity leads to unpredictable outcomes.
-   **Strategic Role-Playing:** Assigning a well-defined persona to the LLM (e.g., "You are a senior software engineer specializing in Python," "Act as a seasoned marketing strategist") can profoundly influence its response style, content, and adherence to domain-specific conventions.

## 1. Summarization Templates

Summarization prompts are engineered to condense extensive information while meticulously preserving core details and critical insights.

### 1.1. Concise Summary (One-Sentence / Short Paragraph)

**Purpose:** Rapidly extract the core idea or executive overview.
**Template:**
```
"Summarize the following text in {number} sentence(s):
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"Summarize the following text in one sentence:
---
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This classic pangram is often used to test typewriters and computer keyboards because it contains all letters of the English alphabet.
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Always specify the exact length or format (e.g., "one sentence," "a short paragraph") to ensure predictable output.

### 1.2. Bullet Point Summary

**Purpose:** Extract and present key information in an easily digestible, scannable list format.
**Template:**
```
"You are a summarization assistant. Summarize the following into {number} concise bullet points, focusing on the main arguments:
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"You are a summarization assistant. Summarize the following into three concise bullet points, focusing on the main arguments:
---
[Long article text about climate change impacts]
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Explicitly define the number of bullet points and the precise focus (e.g., "main arguments," "key findings," "actionable insights").

### 1.3. Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Deliver a high-level overview tailored for decision-makers, frequently incorporating strategic recommendations or critical implications.
**Template:**
```
"You are an expert analyst. Provide an executive summary of the following report, including key findings, implications, and a brief recommendation.

## 7. Advanced Prompting Techniques

This section explores more sophisticated prompting strategies for enhanced control and performance.

### 7.1. Few-Shot Learning

**Purpose:** Guide the LLM's output style and format by providing a small number of input-output examples. This is particularly effective for tasks requiring specific formatting or nuanced understanding.
**Template:**
```
"You are a text rewriter. Rewrite the following sentences in a formal, academic tone.

Example 1:
Input: "Hey, can you quickly summarize this report?"
Output: "Kindly provide a concise summary of the aforementioned report."

Example 2:
Input: "I need to get this done ASAP."
Output: "It is imperative that this task be completed with utmost urgency."

Input: "{text_to_rewrite}"
Output:"
```
**Best Practice:** Ensure examples are diverse enough to cover variations but consistent in style. Place examples before the main query.

### 7.2. Persona Engineering

**Purpose:** Define a specific role or identity for the LLM to adopt, influencing its tone, knowledge base, and response style. A well-crafted persona can significantly improve the relevance and quality of generated content.
**Template:**
```
"You are a seasoned cybersecurity expert, explaining complex vulnerabilities to a non-technical executive audience. Your goal is to be clear, concise, and emphasize business impact.

Explain the concept of a 'zero-day exploit' and its potential implications for a corporate network.
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Be highly specific about the persona's expertise, target audience, and communication goals. Consider including traits like "empathetic," "authoritative," or "creative."

### 7.3. Iterative Prompt Refinement

**Purpose:** A systematic approach to improving prompt performance by analyzing failures, identifying root causes, and incrementally adjusting the prompt. This is crucial for achieving robust and reliable LLM outputs.

**Process:**
1.  **Define Success Criteria:** Clearly articulate what constitutes a "good" output.
2.  **Initial Prompt & Test:** Draft a prompt and test it with diverse inputs.
3.  **Analyze Failures:** For each suboptimal output, identify *why* it failed (e.g., ambiguity, missing context, incorrect format).
4.  **Hypothesize & Adjust:** Formulate a hypothesis about the cause of failure and modify the prompt accordingly.
5.  **Re-test & Evaluate:** Test the revised prompt and compare results against success criteria. Repeat until desired performance is met.

**Example Scenario:**
*Initial Prompt:* "Summarize this article."
*Problem:* Summaries are too long and include irrelevant details.
*Refinement 1 (Add length constraint):* "Summarize this article in 3 sentences."
*Problem:* Still includes some irrelevant details.
*Refinement 2 (Add focus):* "Summarize this article in 3 sentences, focusing only on the main arguments."
*Problem:* Sometimes misses key numerical data.
*Refinement 3 (Add specific instruction):* "Summarize this article in 3 sentences, focusing only on the main arguments. Include any key numerical data."

**Best Practice:** Maintain a log of prompt versions and their performance. Focus on one change at a time to isolate impact.

## Quick-Use Snippet Guidelines

-   **Variables:** Always replace content within `{curly_braces}` with your specific input data.
-   **Role/Context:** Consistently prepend a clear role or context line (e.g., "You are a friendly assistant.", "Act as a cybersecurity expert.") to precisely guide the model's persona and response style.
-   **Constraints:** Append explicit format or length constraints (e.g., "Answer in 2 sentences.", "Format as a JSON array.", "Limit to 100 words.") to rigorously ensure the desired output structure and brevity.
-   **Few-Shot Examples:** For complex tasks, specific styles, or nuanced understanding, always include 1-3 input/output examples directly before your main query. This significantly improves the model's ability to mimic desired behavior.
