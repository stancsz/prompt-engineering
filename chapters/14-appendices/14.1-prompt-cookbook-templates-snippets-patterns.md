```

### Three-Bullet Summary

“You are a summarization assistant. Summarize the following into three bullet points:  
<text>”
```

## 2. Translation Snippets

### Literal Translation  
```
“Translate to {language} (literal):  
<text>”
```

### Formality Control  
```
“Translate to {language} in a {tone} tone:  
<text>”
```

## 3. Classification Patterns

### Sentiment  
```
“Classify the sentiment of this text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative:  
<text>”
```

### Topic  
```
“You are a topic classifier. Assign one of {topics} to the following text:  
<text>”
```

## 4. QA & Extraction

Question: <question>”
```

```

## 5. Chain-of-Thought Starter

“You are an expert reasoner. Show your work step by step when solving:  
<problem>”
```

## 6. Meta-Prompt Example

```
“You are a prompt-generation assistant. Given the task <task>, generate a clear prompt template with variables and usage examples.”
```

## Quick-Use Snippet

- Replace variables in `{curly_braces}`.  
- Prepend a role or context line (e.g., “You are a friendly assistant.”).  
- Append format constraints (e.g., “Answer in 2 sentences.”).
