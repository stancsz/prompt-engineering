# Appendix A: Prompt Cookbook â€“ Templates, Snippets & Patterns

This cookbook provides a curated collection of reusable prompt templates, snippets, and design patterns. Use these as starting points for common tasks, adapting them to your specific needs and iterating for optimal performance.

## General Principles for Using This Cookbook

-   **Adapt, Don't Just Copy:** These are templates. Modify them to fit your specific context, desired tone, and output format.
-   **Iterate:** Prompt engineering is iterative. Experiment with variations, evaluate outputs, and refine your prompts.
-   **Context is King:** Always consider the context you provide. More relevant context often leads to better results.
-   **Clarity and Specificity:** Be explicit about your instructions, constraints, and desired output format.
-   **Role-Playing:** Assigning a persona to the LLM (e.g., "You are a senior software engineer") can significantly influence its response style and content.

## 1. Summarization Templates

Summarization prompts aim to condense information while retaining key details.

### 1.1. Concise Summary (One-Sentence / Short Paragraph)

**Purpose:** Get the main idea quickly.
**Template:**
```
"Summarize the following text in {number} sentence(s):
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"Summarize the following text in one sentence:
---
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This classic pangram is often used to test typewriters and computer keyboards because it contains all letters of the English alphabet.
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Specify the exact length or format (e.g., "one sentence," "a short paragraph").

### 1.2. Bullet Point Summary

**Purpose:** Extract key information in an easily digestible list format.
**Template:**
```
"You are a summarization assistant. Summarize the following into {number} concise bullet points, focusing on the main arguments:
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"You are a summarization assistant. Summarize the following into three concise bullet points, focusing on the main arguments:
---
[Long article text about climate change impacts]
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Define the number of bullet points and the focus (e.g., "main arguments," "key findings").

### 1.3. Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Provide a high-level overview for decision-makers, often including recommendations or implications.
**Template:**
```
"You are an expert analyst. Provide an executive summary of the following report, including key findings, implications, and a brief recommendation.
---
{report_text}
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Clearly define the target audience and required sections (e.g., "key findings," "recommendations").

## 2. Translation Snippets

Translation prompts focus on converting text between languages, often with specific stylistic or formal requirements.

### 2.1. Literal Translation

**Purpose:** Direct, word-for-word or phrase-for-phrase translation, prioritizing accuracy over fluency.
**Template:**
```
"Translate the following text from {source_language} to {target_language} (literal translation):
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"Translate the following text from English to French (literal translation):
---
It is raining cats and dogs.
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Specify "literal" or "word-for-word" to guide the model.

### 2.2. Formal/Informal Translation

**Purpose:** Translate while maintaining a specific tone or formality level.
**Template:**
```
"Translate the following text from {source_language} to {target_language}. Maintain a {formal/informal} tone suitable for {context}:
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"Translate the following text from English to Spanish. Maintain a formal tone suitable for a business email:
---
Please find attached the report for your review.
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Provide clear context for the desired tone.

### 2.3. Localization-Aware Translation

**Purpose:** Translate and adapt content for a specific cultural or regional context.
**Template:**
```
"Translate the following marketing copy from {source_language} to {target_language} for the {target_region} market. Ensure cultural appropriateness and local idioms are used where natural:
---
{text}
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Specify the target region and any cultural nuances to consider.

## 3. Classification Patterns

Classification prompts categorize input text into predefined labels.

### 3.1. Sentiment Analysis

**Purpose:** Determine the emotional tone of a text.
**Template:**
```
"Classify the sentiment of the following text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative:
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"Classify the sentiment of the following text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative:
---
The customer service was terrible, but the product itself is excellent.
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Provide a clear, exhaustive list of possible categories.

### 3.2. Topic Classification

**Purpose:** Assign one or more topics to a given text from a predefined list.
**Template:**
```
"You are a topic classifier. Assign one or more of the following topics to the text below: {topic_list}. If no topic applies, state 'None'.
---
{text}
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"You are a topic classifier. Assign one or more of the following topics to the text below: 'Technology', 'Finance', 'Healthcare', 'Sports', 'Politics'. If no topic applies, state 'None'.
---

---"
```
**Best Practice:** Provide a diverse and relevant list of topics.

### 3.3. Urgency/Priority Classification

**Purpose:** Categorize requests or messages by their urgency or priority level.
**Template:**
```
"Classify the urgency of the following customer support ticket as High, Medium, or Low. Provide a brief justification.
---
{ticket_description}
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Define the criteria for each urgency level if not self-evident.

## 4. QA & Extraction

These prompts are designed to retrieve specific information or answer questions based on provided context.

### 4.1. Question Answering (Context-Based)

**Purpose:** Answer a question using only the provided context, preventing hallucination.

## 6. Reasoning & Problem Solving

Prompts that leverage the LLM's ability to reason and break down problems.

### 6.1. Chain-of-Thought Starter

**Purpose:** Encourage the LLM to show its reasoning process, leading to more accurate and verifiable answers.
**Template:**
```
"You are an expert reasoner. Show your work step by step when solving the following problem. Explain each step clearly.

```
**Best Practice:** Provide clear criteria for evaluation.

## 7. Meta-Prompting

Prompts that instruct the LLM to generate or refine other prompts.

### 7.1. Prompt Template Generator

**Purpose:** Have the LLM create a prompt template for a new task.
**Template:**
```
"You are a prompt-generation assistant. Given the task '{task}', generate a clear and effective prompt template. Include:
- A suitable persona for the AI.
- Clear instructions.
- Placeholder variables (e.g., {variable_name}).
- An example of how to use the template.
---"
```
**Example:**
```
"You are a prompt-generation assistant. Given the task 'Generate social media captions for a new product launch', generate a clear and effective prompt template. Include:
- A suitable persona for the AI.
- Clear instructions.
- Placeholder variables (e.g., {variable_name}).
- An example of how to use the template.
---"
```
**Best Practice:** Be specific about the components you want in the generated prompt.

## Quick-Use Snippet Guidelines

-   **Variables:** Replace content within `{curly_braces}` with your specific input.
-   **Role/Context:** Always consider prepending a role or context line (e.g., "You are a friendly assistant.", "Act as a cybersecurity expert.") to guide the model's persona.
-   **Constraints:** Append format or length constraints (e.g., "Answer in 2 sentences.", "Format as a JSON array.", "Limit to 100 words.") to ensure desired output structure.
-   **Few-Shot Examples:** For complex tasks or specific styles, include 1-3 input/output examples before your main query.
