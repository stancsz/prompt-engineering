# 12.1 Enterprise-Scale Deployments

Large organizations integrate prompt engineering into complex systems, requiring reliability, governance, and cost management.

## Key Elements

- **Governance & Compliance:** Data privacy (HIPAA, GDPR), audit logging, and policy enforcement.  
- **High Throughput & SLAs:** Architect for thousands of concurrent requests and defined service-level objectives.  
- **Cost Optimization:** Model choice (batch vs. real time), prompt caching, dynamic sampling.  
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Shared prompt libraries, centralized MLOps, and democratized access controls.

## Example Case Study

**Global Retailer Chatbot**  
- **Use Case:** Automated customer queries, returns, and order tracking.  
- **Architecture:**  
  1. Front-end collects structured query.  
  2. RAG pipeline retrieves product, order history.  
  3. LLM generates response, stored in audit log.  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - 40% reduction in support tickets.  
  - 5â€“10% monthly savings via caching and off-peak batch processing.

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Sketch an architecture diagram for an LLM-based support system handling 5k QPS.  
2. Identify points for caching, rate limiting, and fallback to human agents.  
3. Outline compliance requirements and data flows for auditing.

## Reflection

- What trade-offs emerged between real-time and batch responses?  
- Which governance controls were simplest to implement?  
- How did cost controls affect user experience?
