# 12.2 Startups & MVPs

Early‐stage teams use prompt engineering to rapidly prototype features, validate ideas, and iterate on minimal viable products (MVPs).

## Key Elements

- **Speed over Perfection:** Focus on proof‐of‐concept prompts that “just work.”  
- **User Feedback Loop:** Deploy small user tests to collect qualitative and quantitative feedback.  
- **Iterative Refinement:** Adjust prompt templates based on usage patterns and error reports.  
- **Cost Management:** Leverage smaller models or low‐cost tokens for MVPs.

## Example Case Study

**AI-Driven Content Generator**  
- **MVP Prompt:**  
  ```
  You are a copywriter. Generate three headline options for a blog on “remote work productivity.”
  ```  
- **User Test:** Shared with 20 beta users; measured click-through preference.  
- **Iteration:** Added “include one question-style headline” based on feedback.

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Draft a simple prompt for a feature you want to validate (e.g., “Generate product taglines”).  
2. Deploy it on a static page or chat widget.  
3. Collect user choices or ratings on the output.  
4. Refine prompt to improve top‐rated responses.

## Reflection

- What user insights emerged from the MVP test?  
- How did prompt adjustments affect engagement metrics?  
- Which trade‐offs did you make between cost, latency, and quality?
