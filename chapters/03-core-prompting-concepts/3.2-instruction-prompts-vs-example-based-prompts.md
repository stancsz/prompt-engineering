# 3.2 Instruction Prompts vs. Example-Based Prompts

Two common styles of prompting help guide LLM behavior:

## Instruction Prompts

- **Definition:** Direct commands that describe the task.  
- **Strengths:** Concise, clear intent, minimal tokens.  
- **Limitations:** May lack context about formatting or style.

### Example

```
Summarize the following paragraph in one sentence:
“AI can transform industries by automating tasks…”
```

## Example-Based Prompts

- **Definition:** Provide one or more input–output examples before the query.  
- **Strengths:** Demonstrates desired format and style.  
- **Limitations:** Consumes more tokens, can truncate context window.

### Example

```
Input: “The sky is blue because…”
Output: “Atmospheric particles scatter blue light more than other colors.”

Input: “Water boils at 100°C because…”
Output:
```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Build an instruction prompt to classify sentiment:  
   ```
   Classify the sentiment of this review as positive, neutral, or negative:
   “I loved the new café’s ambiance.”
   ```
2. Convert it into an example-based prompt with two examples.  
3. Compare responses for precision and style.

## Reflection

- Which style gave more consistent formatting?  
- How much did examples improve clarity?  
- When might you prefer one approach over the other?
