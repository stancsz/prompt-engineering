# 3.3 Prompt Framing, Phrasing, and Clarity

How you frame and phrase a prompt directly impacts model understanding and output quality.

## Key Principles

1. **Be Specific:** Include exactly what you want (e.g., “List three benefits of solar energy.”).  
2. **Use Clear Language:** Avoid ambiguous words or jargon when possible.  
3. **Set Constraints:** Define format, length, style (e.g., “Answer in two sentences.”).  
4. **Provide Context:** Give necessary background or role instructions.

## Examples

- Poor:  
  ```
  Tell me about climate change.
  ```
- Better:  
  ```
  You are an environmental scientist. Summarize three major causes of climate change in bullet points.
  ```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Take a vague request (“Explain my code”).  
2. Rewrite with role and format:  
   ```
   You are a senior developer. Explain the following Python function in plain English and list edge cases.
   ```  
3. Test both versions in an LLM playground and compare clarity.

## Reflection

- Which prompt yielded a more focused and useful response?  
- How did adding context and constraints change the output?
