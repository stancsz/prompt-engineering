# 3.1 Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot Learning

Language models can generalize with varying amounts of context:

## Definitions

- **Zero-Shot** – No examples are provided; model relies purely on instructions.  
- **One-Shot** – A single example helps illustrate the task.  
- **Few-Shot** – Multiple examples demonstrate the pattern before the query.

## Example Prompts

- **Zero-Shot**  
  ```
  Translate to Spanish: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
  ```
- **One-Shot**  
  ```
  English → French
  Example: “Hello, how are you?” → “Bonjour, comment ça va ?”
  Now translate: “Good night and sweet dreams.”
  ```
- **Few-Shot**  
  ```
  English → German
  1. “Thank you.” → “Danke.”
  2. “See you later.” → “Bis später.”
  3. “Where is the train station?” → 
  ```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. In an LLM playground, run the zero-shot translation example.  
2. Add one example and observe change in accuracy.  
3. Provide three examples (few-shot) and compare fluency and correctness.

## Reflection

- How did adding examples improve the output?  
- Where did the model still make mistakes?  
- Which approach required the least prompt engineering effort?
