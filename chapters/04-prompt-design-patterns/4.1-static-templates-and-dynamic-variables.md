# 4.1 Static Templates and Dynamic Variables

As prompt engineering moves beyond ad-hoc queries to systematic application development, the need for structured and reusable prompts becomes paramount. The **static templates and dynamic variables** pattern addresses this by providing a fixed prompt structure with placeholders that are populated at runtime. This approach significantly reduces repetition, enforces consistency, and improves the maintainability and scalability of LLM-powered applications.

## The Pattern: Structure and Placeholders

A prompt template consists of:

*   **Static Text:** The unchanging core instructions, context, or formatting guidelines that define the general task. This part remains constant across different invocations of the template.
*   **Dynamic Variables (Placeholders):** Specific sections within the static text that are designed to be replaced with user-provided input, retrieved data, or other context-specific information at the time the prompt is sent to the LLM. These are typically denoted by curly braces (e.g., `{variable_name}`).

**General Structure:**
```
[Static Instruction/Role]
[Static Context/Guidelines]
{variable_1}
[More Static Instructions]
{variable_2}
[Desired Output Format]
```

**Example Template:**
```
You are a {role}. Your task is to {task_description}.
The input data is provided below, delimited by triple backticks:
```{input_data}```

Ensure the output is {output_format} and {tone}.
```

*   **Static Text:** "You are a", ". Your task is to", "The input data is provided below, delimited by triple backticks:", "Ensure the output is", "and".
*   **Variables:** `{role}`, `{task_description}`, `{input_data}`, `{output_format}`, `{tone}`.

## Benefits of Using Templates

*   **Consistency:** Ensures that all prompts for a given task adhere to a predefined structure and include all necessary instructions, reducing variability in LLM responses.
*   **Reusability:** A single template can be used for numerous instances of a task, simply by changing the variable values. This avoids writing similar prompts repeatedly.
*   **Maintainability:** Changes to the core prompt logic (static text) only need to be made in one place, propagating across all uses of the template.
*   **Reduced Errors:** Standardized structure minimizes the chance of human error in prompt construction.
*   **Scalability:** Facilitates the programmatic generation of prompts in production systems, enabling large-scale LLM interactions.
*   **Collaboration:** Teams can define and share common templates, ensuring a unified approach to prompt design.

## Designing Effective Templates

1.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for recurring instructions, roles, or output formats across your prompts. These are good candidates for static text.
2.  **Parameterize Dynamic Content:** Determine which parts of your prompts change with each specific use case. These become your variables.
    *   *Examples:* User queries, document content, specific entities to extract, target audience, desired length, specific keywords.
3.  **Use Descriptive Variable Names:** Choose names that clearly indicate the expected content of the variable (e.g., `{customer_query}` instead of `{input}`).
4.  **Employ Delimiters for Input Data:** When injecting large blocks of text (like articles, code, or user conversations), use clear delimiters (e.g., triple backticks ```` ``` ````, XML tags `<text>`, `---`) to prevent the LLM from misinterpreting the dynamic content as part of the instructions.
5.  **Keep Static Text Concise:** While providing clear instructions, avoid unnecessary verbosity in the static parts of the template.

## Example: A Comprehensive Content Generation Template

**Scenario:** Generating various types of marketing content (e.g., social media posts, email subject lines, blog intros) for different products and audiences.

**Template:**
```
You are a {persona} for {company_name}.
Your goal is to generate {content_type} for the product: "{product_name}".

Target Audience: {target_audience}
Key Selling Points: {selling_points}

Instructions:
- The tone should be {tone}.
- Keep the length to {length_constraint}.
- Include a call to action: "{call_to_action}".
- Do not include any {negative_constraint}.

Generated Content:
```

**Filled Prompt Instance 1 (Social Media Post):**
```
You are a marketing specialist for EcoSolutions.
Your goal is to generate a Twitter post for the product: "Eco-Friendly Water Bottle".

Target Audience: Environmentally conscious millennials
Key Selling Points: Durable, BPA-free, stylish design, reduces plastic waste

Instructions:
- The tone should be enthusiastic and inspiring.
- Keep the length to under 280 characters.
- Include a call to action: "Shop now at ecosolutions.com!".
- Do not include any technical specifications.

Generated Content:
```

**Filled Prompt Instance 2 (Email Subject Line):**
```
You are a marketing specialist for EcoSolutions.
Your goal is to generate an email subject line for the product: "Eco-Friendly Water Bottle".

Target Audience: Existing customers
Key Selling Points: Durable, BPA-free, stylish design, reduces plastic waste

Instructions:
- The tone should be exciting and urgent.
- Keep the length to under 50 characters.
- Include a call to action: "Shop now at ecosolutions.com!".
- Do not include any emojis.

Generated Content:
```

## Hands-On Exercise: Building and Using a Template

1.  **Choose a Recurring Task:** Select a task you might perform repeatedly, such as generating short product descriptions for an e-commerce site.
2.  **Identify Static and Dynamic Parts:**
    *   What instructions remain the same for every product description? (e.g., "You are an e-commerce copywriter," "Write a product description.")
    *   What information changes per product? (e.g., product name, key features, target audience, desired length).
3.  **Design Your Template:** Create a markdown file (e.g., `product_description_template.md`) and define your template using placeholders.
    ```markdown
    You are an e-commerce copywriter for a modern tech store.
    Write a product description for the "{product_name}".

    Key Features: {features}
    Target Audience: {audience}
    Desired Length: {length}

    Product Description:
    ```
4.  **Populate and Test:**
    *   **Scenario 1 (Smartwatch):**
        *   `product_name`: "Zenith Smartwatch"
        *   `features`: "Heart rate monitoring, GPS, 7-day battery life, waterproof"
        *   `audience`: "Fitness enthusiasts"
        *   `length`: "under 75 words"
    *   **Scenario 2 (Noise-Cancelling Headphones):**
        *   `product_name`: "AuraFlow Headphones"
        *   `features`: "Active noise cancellation, 30-hour battery, ergonomic design, crystal-clear audio"
        *   `audience`: "Commuters and remote workers"
        *   `length`: "around 100 words"
    *   Paste the filled prompts into an LLM playground and observe the outputs.

## Reflection

*   How did the template streamline the process of generating multiple product descriptions compared to writing each from scratch?
*   Were there any variables you initially missed that would have improved the template's flexibility?
*   Did the LLM consistently adhere to the specified `length` and `audience` constraints across different filled prompts?
*   How might you manage these templates and their variable data in a real-world application (e.g., using a configuration file or a database)?

## Considerations and Best Practices

*   **Version Control:** Store your prompt templates in version control (e.g., Git) alongside your code.
*   **Validation:** Implement checks to ensure all dynamic variables are populated before sending the prompt to the LLM.
*   **Escape Characters:** Be mindful of special characters within dynamic variables that might interfere with the prompt's structure (e.g., if your delimiter is `"""`, ensure `"""` doesn't appear in your `input_data`).
*   **Modularity:** For very complex tasks, consider breaking down a large template into smaller, modular sub-templates that can be combined.
*   **Prompt Libraries:** Utilize prompt management libraries or frameworks (covered in Chapter 7) that provide built-in support for templating and variable management.
