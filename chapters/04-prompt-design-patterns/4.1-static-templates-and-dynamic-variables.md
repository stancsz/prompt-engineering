# 4.1 Static Templates and Dynamic Variables

Static templates provide a fixed structure with placeholders (variables) you fill at runtime. This pattern reduces repetition and enforces consistency.

## Pattern

```
You are a {role}. {instruction}. Output as {format}.
```

- **Static text:** Describes the task at a high level.  
- **Variables:** `{role}`, `{instruction}`, `{format}` â€” replaced per use case.

## Example

**Template:**  
```
You are a {role}. Translate the following sentence to {language}: "{text}"
```

**Filled:**  
```
You are a professional translator. Translate the following sentence to French: "Data science is fascinating."
```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Create a template for summarization with three variables:  
   - `{audience}`, `{length}`, `{content}`  
2. Fill it for two scenarios:  
   - Executive summary for a board meeting.  
   - Tweet-length summary for social media.  
3. Compare outputs and adjust placeholders for clarity.

## Reflection

- How did using a template speed up prompt creation?  
- Which variable names made the template most intuitive?  
- Did outputs remain consistent across different inputs?
