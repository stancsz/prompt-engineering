# 4.5 Meta-Prompting & Higher-Order Prompts

Meta-prompting uses prompts to generate or refine other prompts, enabling scalable and adaptive workflows.

## Concept

- **Meta-Prompt:** A prompt whose output is itself a new prompt.  
- **Higher-Order Prompts:** Chains of prompts where each stage refines or validates the previous.

## Example

**Meta-Prompt:**  
```
You are a prompt engineer assistant. Given the task “summarize a research paper in 50 words,” generate a clear prompt template users can directly fill.
```

**Model Output (New Prompt):**  
```
You are a summarization assistant. Summarize the following research paper in exactly 50 words, focusing on methodology and key results:
<insert paper abstract here>
```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Choose a task you repeat often (e.g., “translate tweets”).  
2. Write a meta-prompt that produces a reusable prompt template.  
3. Run it in an LLM playground, copy the resulting prompt, fill in variables, and test.

## Reflection

- How did the meta-prompt improve your workflow?  
- What edge cases did the generated prompt miss?  
- How could you iterate the meta-prompt for better templates?
