# 4.4 Context Management & Window Optimization

Managing context efficiently ensures critical information isn’t lost and token limits aren’t exceeded.

## Concepts

- **Chunking** – Split large inputs into smaller, coherent pieces.  
- **Summarization** – Replace earlier context with concise summaries.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Prompts** – Dynamically fetch relevant documents.  

## Example Techniques

1. **Chunk & Iterate**  
   ```
   You are an editor. Summarize these paragraphs section by section:
   [Section 1 text]
   ```
2. **Summarize-Then-Use**  
   ```
   Summary of chapter so far: [summary].
   Continue story from “The hero entered the…” 
   ```
3. **Dynamic Retrieval**  
   ```
   Fetch document titled “API Guide” and extract usage examples for authentication.
   ```

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Take a 1,500-word article.  
2. Chunk into 500-word sections, prompt for summaries, then combine.  
3. Compare quality vs. feeding full text to a 1,000-token model.

## Reflection

- Which method preserved key details best?  
- How did summary length affect subsequent prompts?
