# 4.2 Chain-of-Thought & Step-by-Step Reasoning

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting encourages the model to “think aloud,” improving multi-step reasoning.

## Concept

- **Chain-of-Thought:** Asking the model to explain its reasoning steps before answering.  
- **Benefit:** Reduces errors on complex tasks (math, logic, planning).

## Example

```
You are an expert mathematician. Solve this and show your work step by step:
“12 × 15 – (8 + 2) = ?”
```

**Model might output:**  
1. 12×15 = 180  
2. 8+2 = 10  
3. 180 – 10 = 170  
**Answer:** 170

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Choose a multi-step problem (e.g., “What is 45% of 320?”).  
2. Prompt with CoT:  
   ```
   You are a tutor. Explain each calculation step when solving “45% of 320.”
   ```  
3. Review the chain-of-thought and verify each step.

## Reflection

- Did the model catch every step correctly?  
- How does CoT compare to a direct answer prompt?  
- When is CoT most useful?
