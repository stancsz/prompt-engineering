# 13.2 Self-Improving & Autonomous Systems

Future AI agents will autonomously refine their own prompts and models, closing the loop between usage and improvement.

## Key Concepts

- **Self-Improvement Loop:** Agents generate candidate prompts, evaluate performance, and update templates automatically.  
- **Meta-Learning:** Models learn to learn, adapting to new tasks with minimal data.  
- **Automated Feedback:** Continuous monitoring feeds back into prompt tuning and parameter adjustment.  
- **Humanâ€“Agent Collaboration:** Humans define objectives; agents optimize under guardrails.

## Example Workflow

1. **Generate Prompt Variants:**  
   Agent uses meta-prompt to propose three new prompt templates for a translation task.  
2. **Evaluate Performance:**  
   Test each variant on a held-out dataset, measuring BLEU score or human feedback.  
3. **Select & Deploy:**  
   Automatically promote the highest-scoring prompt to production.  
4. **Monitor & Iterate:**  
   Track live metrics (latency, accuracy) and trigger re-evaluation when drift is detected.

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Write a meta-prompt that asks an LLM to suggest improvements to a customer-support prompt.  
2. Programmatically test suggested prompts against sample tickets and score accuracy.  
3. Automate selection of the best variant and log results in an experiment tracker.

## Reflection

- How did autonomous selection compare to manual tuning?  
- What risks arise when agents self-optimize without human oversight?  
- Which safeguards ensure reliable self-improvement?
